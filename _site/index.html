	<div class="post-content"><p>In order to write about Open-Transactions I will elaborate on some features of Bitcoin first. Bitcoin is a completely transparent protocol, a scarce resource, a community, a payment system, a commodity, a unit of account, a ledger plus a lot more. It currently raises a benchmark for what is now called cryptocurrency or digital money.</p>

<p>Bitcoin behaves like a commodity in a sense that one cannot have a negative balance just like one cannot have a physically negative gold balance. Within the Bitcoin protocol there is no way to lend or owe anyone Bitcoin and transactions cannot be reversed. The current world markets trade commodities and resources without physically moving them though. This is achieved with the help of tokens which are denominated in the commodity. The system is based on trust in the issuer of the tokens. He has the commodity available according to terms agreed.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>In July of 2011, the owners of popular web wallet service and payment processor MyBitcoin.com <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/k08a8/has_bruce_wagner_pulled_off_the_biggest_financial/">absconded</a> with all customer funds, almost 79 thousand bitcoins, and disappeared.</p>

<p>In March of 2012, several sites hosted with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/03/bitcoins-worth-228000-stolen-from-customers-of-hacked-webhost/">Linode</a> were hacked, including leveraged trading platform Bitcoinica, mining pool Bitcoin.cz, Bitcoin Faucet, and several other sites. A total of about 47 thousand bitcoins were lost.</p>

<p>Two months later, Bitcoinica was hacked <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/255595/hackers_break_into_bitcoin_exchange_site_bitcoinica_steal_90000_in_bitcoins.html">again</a> and lost another 19 thousand bitcoins, causing it to shut down.</p>

<p>Two months after that, someone stole 40 thousand bitcoins from Bitcoinica’s <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93074">Mt Gox account</a>, 30% of their remaining assets.</p>

<p>In September of 2012, exchange platform <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/2139/bitfloor-hacked-250000-missing/">Bitfloor</a> was hacked and lost about 24 thousand customer bitcoins.</p>

<p>In October 2013, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/25/fbi-says-its-seized-20-million-in-bitcoins-from-ross-ulbricht-alleged-owner-of-silk-road/">Silk Road</a> users lost 172 thousand bitcoins when they were seized by the FBI.</p>

<p>The months of November and December 2013 have been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2516024/Bitcoin-thefts-soar-online-criminals-target-easy-payday-currencys-value-quadruples-space-weeks.html">particularly bad</a> in terms of Bitcoin companies losing funds to theft, with Inputs.io, BIPS, Bidextreme all reporting losses.</p>

<p>In virtually every case of companies losing customer funds, it’s difficult or impossible to disprove that an inside job was responsible.</p></div>

<h2 id="the_past">The Past</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://mises.org/daily/2542#4">eleventh and twelfth centuries</a>, increases in agricultural production and urbanization led to a new rise of a new professional merchant class who traded within and among towns and kingdoms. Customary law by this time had grown localized, so the merchants needed a universal body of law in order for trade to function on inter-regional levels. This began with a recognition of common customs that already existed, and from there merchants began experimenting with their own contract law, where contracts themselves were the source of law. Because contracts require voluntary entry, objectivity and impartial recognition and enforcement of the law was expected by anyone entering. Merchants would only voluntarily take part in a legal system that treated them fairly. Over time, these voluntary and experimental contractual agreements grew into a universal body of law known as <em>lex mercatoria</em> or the “Law Merchant.”</p>

<p><em>Lex mercatoria</em> required no intervening rulers to dictate the law, and in fact its statelessness was the key feature that allowed it to flourish and benefit merchants who sought peaceful inter-regional trade. Indeed, merchants preferred their own court systems recognizing <em>lex mercatoria</em> over royal courts. Royal courts would often refuse to see cases involving contracts made in foreign countries. They would refuse to recognize interest agreements on charges of usury. They would refuse to use accounting books as evidence, despite them being central to merchant cases. They were unable to handle technical cases. They were slow and bureaucratic. On the other hand, merchant courts recognized a universal law that could apply to everyone, so geography was not an issue. They recognized voluntary contracts given they held up to community standards. They understood what mattered for cases and could compete in niches that required technical knowledge. They favored expedience and informality so that merchants could get back to business. Instead of physical punishment, merchants could use social incentives such as ostracization. By the thirteenth century, <em>lex mercatoria</em> was a body of law universally recognized by merchants and proved that commercial law can develop outside of the state apparatus and perhaps it should remain there.</p></div>
